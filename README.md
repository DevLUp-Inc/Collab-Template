# Collab Template

> Note: It is recommended to replace this section with a description about your project.

This template aims to provide the following:

1. A simple Git workflow designed for teams.
2. Guidelines for project organization.
3. A place to consolidate project resources and documentation.

The information is broken up into different roles:

1. [Contributors](/docs/collab-template/contributors.md) work on code and other assets within this repo.
2. [Code Reviewers](/docs/collab-template/code-reviewers.md) review pull requests and merge them.
3. [Repository Maintainers](/docs/collab-template/repository-maintainers.md) set up the repo and establish standards for project organization.

When onboarding new members to the project, you can point them towards
the respective sections and answer any additional questions they have.
Note that a member can play multiple roles.

### Project Organization Resources

Here are some resources for deciding on how to organize your
project, however, note that much of this is subject to opinion and can
differ depending on the needs of your project. However, in any case,
being consistent is more important than being "correct".
