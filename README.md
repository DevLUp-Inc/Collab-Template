# Collab Template

> Note: It is recommended to replace this section with a description about your project.

This template aims to provide the following:

1. A simple Git workflow designed for teams.
2. Guidelines for project organization.
3. A place to consolidate project resources and documentation.

## Repository Setup

> Note: Remove this section when done

1. First start by pressing the green 'Use this template' button as
   shown below and give your new repo a name. This will create a copy
   of this repo under your control.

2. Add your project either directly into the root folder of the repo OR as a subfolder.

3. Add a `.gitignore` file into your project folder. This tells Git to
   ignore certain files and folders in your project. This often is the
   difference between a 1 GB sized repo and a few MB sized repo.

   This website can help you generate a suitable `.gitignore` for your project: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

4. Read through the remainder of this README.

If you are ever stuck, don't hesitate a teammate! In addition, here are some important links related to the project.

## Workflow Overview

To put it simply, the overall workflow is to:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a development branch.
3. Make and commit your changes.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Switch back to `main` branch.
6. Fetch/Pull any new changes.
7. (Optional) Delete your previous local dev branch.
8. Create a new dev branch with a new name (`dev/previous-name-2`, etc).

After you have opened a pull request, a repository maintainer will review your changes and merge it into the project.

In the case of merge conflicts or any other issue, they will also work with you to resolve the issues or suggest improvements.

### Additional Workflow Tips

1. Try to keep your branches and pull requests small! Smaller branches tend to be more focused and easier to merge.

## Project Organization

> Note: You'll likely want to edit this section to better fit your project.

I (Exanite) recommend dividing your project into four different sections:

1. Project assets
2. Project code
3. Third party code
4. Prototyping

Because code typically isn't meant to be directly used by designers,
sections 1 and 2 create a separation between designers and
programmers.

Likewise, third party code typically shouldn't be modified and is thus
placed in its own folder.

Having a separate prototyping folder also creates a separation between
production ready assets and assets that are used for testing or are in
the middle of development.

### Example

With Unity, this leads to the four following folders in the Assets folder:

1. Project - Stores any project related assets that isn't code. This includes art, music, prefabs, shaders, and much more.
2. Project.Source - Stores any project related code. This is where programmers will work.
3. Plugins - Stores 3rd party assets and code (unless the asset needs to be in a specific folder).
4. Prototype - Contains folders related to each developer's ongoing work. Each developer will have their own folder where they can store anything that isn't ready to be included in the final game.

### Additional Resources

Here are additional resource for deciding on how to organize your
project, however, note that much of this is subject to opinion and can
differ depending on the needs of your project. However, in any case,
being consistent is more important than being "correct", whatever that
may be.

## Quick Github Desktop Guide

This guide will use Github Desktop, but any Git client can be used (e.g., Git command line, Sourcetree, etc).

### ðŸ’¾ Committing
A commit is a group of related changes: `"Add main menu button"` or `"Fix enemy getting stuck on wall"`.

In Github Desktop, commiting takes place on the left side of the window.
Here you can select which files to commit and give your changes a title and description.

> Clicking commit will save your changes into Git locally, but a push is required to upload them to the repo on Github.

### â¬‡ Fetch/Pull
Normally two separate actions, Github has combined them into one button at *the top of the window*. Pull will download the latest changes to your computer.

### â¬† Push
After you *commit*, this will upload your changes to the repo on Github. If you have changes to push, *this will replace the Fetch/Pull button*.

### ðŸŒ² Branching
To avoid merge conflicts, *everyone should have their own development
branch*, unless you are working directly with someone else.

This gives you a separate environment where your code won't be
accidentally changed or broken by others.

For example, Octocat's branch would be named: `dev/octocat`.
You can also name your branch by feature: `dev/combat` or `dev/level-generation`.
If you are fixing a bug, you can also use the `fix` prefix: `fix/play-button-not-working`.

To create a branch, click on the "Current branch" button and type in your desired branch name.

### â¬… Merging
Instead of directly merging your changes back to main, we will be using pull requests. Merging will put your code into the main project.

Once you have made a commit, you can create a pull request in Github Desktop by clicking "Create a pull request from your current branch".
This will take you to the Github webpage where you can give your pull request a title and description.

> Once you click "Create pull request", a repository maintainer will review your code and merge it for you if there aren't any issues.
