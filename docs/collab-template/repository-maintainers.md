# Repository Maintainers

Repository maintainers have the role of setting up the repo and making
sure that it stays in a workable state.

## Repository Setup

1. First start by pressing the green 'Use this template' button as
   shown below and give your new repo a name. This will create a copy
   of this repo.

2. Add your project either directly into the root folder of the repo
   OR as a subfolder.

3. Add a `.gitignore` file into your project folder. This tells Git to
   ignore certain files and folders in your project. This often is the
   difference between a 1 GB sized repo and a few MB sized repo.

   This website can help you generate a suitable `.gitignore` for your
   project: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

4. In the repository [README](/README.md), fill
   the [Project Organization](/README.md#project-organization) section
   with how your project is organized. Resources are provided if you
   don't already have a plan.

5. (Highly recommended) Read through the
   repository [README](/README.md) and the rest of the role specific
   documents.

6. (Optional) Add a license to the project (if open source).
