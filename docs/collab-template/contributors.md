# Contributors

Contributors include anyone who is working within this repo. This
document explains how to start working with this repo and how to
submit your changes.

## Workflow Overview

The following is a simple Git workflow meant to reduce the likelyhood
of merge conflicts. Smaller teams can relax the guidelines while
larger teams can make the guidelines even more strict.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a development branch.
3. Make and commit your changes.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Switch back to `main` branch.
6. Fetch/Pull any new changes.
7. (Optional) Delete your previous local dev branch.
8. Create a new dev branch with a new name (`dev/previous-name-2`, etc).

After you have opened a pull request, a code reviewer will review your
changes and merge it into the project. At this point, the code
reviewer **owns** your branch. Any changes that you make on that
branch must go through them first.

In the case of merge conflicts or any other issue, they will also work
with you to resolve the issues or suggest improvements.

### Additional Workflow Tips

1. Always communicate with your team about what features and files you will be working on.
2. Do not work on a file that a teammate is working on! This will lead to merge conflicts.
3. Try to keep your branches and pull requests small! Smaller branches tend to be more focused and easier to merge.
4. Don't let your branch get outdated. Either update your branch by merging `main` into your branch or create a pull request.
5. Make small commits, even the occassional single line commit. These are called atomic commits and focus on making a commit per completed task.

## Quick Github Desktop Guide

This guide will use Github Desktop, but any Git client can be used (e.g., Git command line, Sourcetree, etc).

### ðŸ’¾ Committing
A commit is a group of related changes: `"Add main menu button"` or `"Fix enemy getting stuck on wall"`.

In Github Desktop, commiting takes place on the left side of the window.
Here you can select which files to commit and give your changes a title and description.

> Clicking commit will save your changes into Git locally, but a push is required to upload them to the repo on Github.

### â¬‡ Fetch/Pull
Normally two separate actions, Github has combined them into one button at *the top of the window*. Pull will download the latest changes to your computer.

### â¬† Push
After you *commit*, this will upload your changes to the repo on Github. If you have changes to push, *this will replace the Fetch/Pull button*.

### ðŸŒ² Branching
To avoid merge conflicts, *everyone should have their own development
branch*, unless you are working directly with someone else.

This gives you a separate environment where your code won't be
accidentally changed or broken by others.

For example, Octocat's branch would be named: `dev/octocat`.
You can also name your branch by feature: `dev/combat` or `dev/level-generation`.
If you are fixing a bug, you can also use the `fix` prefix: `fix/play-button-not-working`.

To create a branch, click on the "Current branch" button and type in your desired branch name.

### â¬… Merging
Instead of directly merging your changes back to main, we will be using pull requests. Merging will put your code into the main project.

Once you have made a commit, you can create a pull request in Github Desktop by clicking "Create a pull request from your current branch".
This will take you to the Github webpage where you can give your pull request a title and description.

> Once you click "Create pull request", a code reviewer will review your code and merge it for you if there aren't any issues.
