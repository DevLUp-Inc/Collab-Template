## Quick Github Desktop Guide

This guide will use Github Desktop, but any Git client can be used (e.g., Git command line, Sourcetree, etc).

### ðŸ’¾ Committing
A commit is a group of related changes: `"Add main menu button"` or `"Fix enemy getting stuck on wall"`.

In Github Desktop, commiting takes place on the left side of the window.
Here you can select which files to commit and give your changes a title and description.

> Clicking commit will save your changes into Git locally, but a push is required to upload them to the repo on Github.

### â¬‡ Fetch/Pull
Normally two separate actions, Github has combined them into one button at *the top of the window*. Pull will download the latest changes to your computer.

### â¬† Push
After you *commit*, this will upload your changes to the repo on Github. If you have changes to push, *this will replace the Fetch/Pull button*.

### ðŸŒ² Branching
To avoid merge conflicts, *everyone should have their own development
branch*, unless you are working directly with someone else.

This gives you a separate environment where your code won't be
accidentally changed or broken by others.

For example, Octocat's branch would be named: `dev/octocat`.
You can also name your branch by feature: `dev/combat` or `dev/level-generation`.
If you are fixing a bug, you can also use the `fix` prefix: `fix/play-button-not-working`.

To create a branch, click on the "Current branch" button and type in your desired branch name.

### â¬… Merging
Instead of directly merging your changes back to main, we will be using pull requests. Merging will put your code into the main project.

Once you have made a commit, you can create a pull request in Github Desktop by clicking "Create a pull request from your current branch".
This will take you to the Github webpage where you can give your pull request a title and description.

> Once you click "Create pull request", a repository maintainer will review your code and merge it for you if there aren't any issues.
